# Iris_Flower_Detection
Support vector machine classifier is one of the most popular machine learning classification algorithm. 
Svm classifier mostly used in addressing multi-classification problems.

I have used the famous Iris dataset for the SVM classification.
The Iris dataset has 3 types of Iris species:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica

The idea of implementing SVM classifier in Python is to use the iris features to train an SVM classifier and use the trained SVM model to predict the Iris species type.
Flask is used for the deployment.
